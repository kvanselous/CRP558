        <h2>Tech Report: ArcGIS JavaScript API </h2>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>ArcGIS JavaScript API is similar to Leaflet as they are both tools developers use to build maps, embed maps in webpages, and connect to libraries to develop maps (Teixeira, 2020). ArcGIS JavaScript API differs from Leaflet in that it allows developers to build 3D visualizations, conduct additional geospatial analysis, and share data easily across Esri products (Teixeira, 2020).  Because ArcGIS JavaScript API works across Esri products, it allows creators to pull data from ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS servers to build maps.  Additionally, it allows creators to integrate ArcGIS widgets across Esri products to increase efficiency (Powell, 2016).  The newest version is 4.14 and includes improved capabilities such as the addition of label options for 3D features, a daylight widget which allows creators to display shadows and lightening in 3D scenes, a widget that allows creators to examine the 'line of sight' from various points in a 3D scene, the ability to update and add attachments to feature layers, tools that help the layer compare visualizations over time periods, and improved clustering abilities that includes GeoJSON layers (Powell & Svensson, 2019).

Please review the below to gain more information about ArcGIS online, APIs, and JavaScript.    </p>      
        <h5>What is ArcGIS online?</h5>
        ArcGIS online is a communication platform that allows users to map location data and connect it with a variety of information.  This tool is used by a wide array of industries including private companies, government, and non-profits.  It is also easy to share.  Not only is it a tool that can that can help organizations drive data informed decision making, but it is also a tool that can help visualize data in interesting and easily interpreted ways (Esri, 2015; Esri, 2020a).  This tool can also be used to store and share data that is used to build maps in ArgGIS JavaScript API.  For more information click <a href="https://youtu.be/FRcv9xmmojE">here</a> to watch a short informational video from Esri or <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview">here</a> to view this tools home page.   
        <h5>JavaScript Refresher</h5>
        JavaScript is a programming language that is read by an internet browser to create actions on webpages (Code School, 2015). We have been using JavaScript throughout the semester to add various behaviors to our visualizations.  If you are interested in viewing a video refresher, please click <a href="https://youtu.be/nItSSTwBvSU">here</a>.        
        <h5>What is an API?</h5>
        An API, or Application Programming Interface, is often described as similar to a waiter in a restaurant (MuleSoft Videos, 2015; Simply Explained, 2019).  In other words, it is a tool that transitions data and information between computer applications, similar to the way a waiter delivers food to a table from the kitchen.  Commonly used applications, such as the weather app or cheap airfare applications like Kayak, use APIs to connect data to the user by way of the application.  Four key purposes of the APIs, as identified in the linked resource in this section, include support in accessing data, hiding website complexities for developers, extending functionality of systems, and acting as gatekeepers to protect user's personal data (Simply Explained, 2019).  These are important aspects to keep in mind as the API allows developers to use minimal and consistent code when creating data visualizations with maps. For more information and examples of APIs can be found in the references <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVvTv9Hy91Q&feature=youtu.be">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY">here</a>.
        <p>While Leaflet and ArcGIS JavaScript API both use APIs, ArcGIS JavaScript API has more features than Leaflet.  Take a look at the feature page for <a href="https://leafletjs.com/#features">Leaflet</a> and <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/">ArcGIS JavaScript API</a>.  You'll notice that the Leaflet page emphasizes its focus on basic features.  Some of the features we've used in previous coursework include visual features to change our maps such as the zoom and pan map options, as well as layer controls (Leaflet, 2019).  You'll notice these features are included in the ArcGIS API reference guide and that this tool includes features for additional analysis such as features that calculate area measurement, conduct time series animation, and conduct 'line of sight' analysis (Esri, 2020b).  </p>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        The above section provides a general overview of the tool, what it can be used for, and the key items that make up this tool.  Next, we will move on to how to register, use, and build a map with this tool, as well as how to add data from ArcGIS Online to ArcGIS JavaScript API (Esri, 2020a). 
        <h5>Sign Up, Download, and Become Familiar With The Tool</h5>
        <p>Follow steps 1 & 2 below to sign up, register, and download ArcGIS JavaScript API.  Follow steps 3-5 to familiarize yourself with the tool and it's capabilities.</p>    
        <br>1) Navigate to the tool's home page and explore the site.  To register for this product, click the 'Get Started' button on the home page: <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/">ArcGIS JavaScript Home Page</a>.
        <br>2) From this page, follow the instructions under the Quick Start Guide to make an ArcGIS for developers account: <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/quick-start/"> Quick Start Guide</a>.
        <br>3) After you make an account, experiment with code from step 3 in the Quick Start Guide and then proceed through the tutorials at the bottom of the Quick Start Guide.  Please note LA 458/558 students can use their preferred code editors and local environments as described in Step 2 of the Quick Guide.  To access the tutorial, you can also follow this link: <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/create-a-starter-app/">Tutorials</a>.
        <br>4) Work through the tutorials.  You'll notice some of the tutorials teach the user familiar concepts learned in LA 458/558 such as adding layers, popups, and mapping line, polygon, and point graphics.  You'll also notice this tool allows the user to learn new skills such as creating a 3D scene, mapping driving directions, and adding layers to 3D maps.  
        <br>5) Similar to previous coursework, ArcGIS has a variety of base maps that can be added to the map.  Explore the base maps here: <a href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/browse/#d=2&type=layers&cont=esriOnly&categories=Basemaps:11111">Basemaps</a>.
        <br>6) Next take a look at my code to see how I created the example map on this page.  I included comments throughout to highlight code used to build this map: <a href="https://github.com/kvanselous/CRP558/blob/master/TechReport/index.html">Example code</a>.
        <h5>Creating and Adding Data with ArcGIS online</h5>
        <p>ArcGIS JavaScript API allows creators to create and add data via ArcGIS online.  To learn more about this process, follow the below steps.</p>
        <br>1)  To begin, navigate back to your ArcGIS for developer's account which you created in the steps above.  From the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/">main ArcGIS for Developers page </a>you can access a developer dashbaord.  You'll notice this connects you to your ArcGIS for Developers account and ArcGIS Online account: <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/dashboard">Developer Dashboard</a>.
        <br>2)  Next download structure data from Aspen, Colorado to follow along with my example:<a href="https://mapaspen-cityofaspen.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/aspen-structures-1">Aspen Buidling Data</a>. 
        <br>3)  From your dashboard, click the 'manage content' button next to your ArcGIS online row and add your Aspen data by clicking 'Add Item' and 'From Your Computer'.  Upload the zipped folder you downloaded in the previous step.  This may take a few minutes to upload.
        <br>4)  While your file is uploading, scroll to the bottom of this page and locate the 'ID' box on the bottom right side of the page.  This is a unique code that will tell the browser where to retreive this data.  Copy this ID and look at lines 178-179 and 208-224 in my code to see how I added this data as a layer in my code: <a href="https://github.com/kvanselous/CRP558/blob/master/TechReport/index.html">Example code</a>. 
        <br>5)  If you have followed along with my code, your map should look like the below example.  If you need additional resources, check out the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-portal/index.html">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/pen?&editable=true&editors=100">Sample Code</a> provided by ArcGIS for Developers. 
        <h3>Example</h3>
        Below, please find the example map referenced above. You'll notice this tool allows the map to display in 3D and gives the viewer an angled view of the map.  Each of these items can be adjusted based on the author's preferences for display.  Use the tools at the top left of the map to explore the map.  You'll notice that the building data is displayed with polygons and that the structures in Aspen, Colorado decrease as elevation increases in this region.      
        
        <!--Below is the code used to display my map with ArcGIS JavaScript API.-->
        <div id="viewDiv"></div>
        
        <!--Below  my text resumes for my Tech Report-->
        <h3>Overall Review</h3>
        <p>Overall, this tool appears to be a 'step up' from Leaflet due to its increased API capabilities and tools for analysis.  While Leaflet is often praised for its simplicity, it seems to be largely used to create maps with basic functionality.  On the other hand, ArcGIS JavaScript API demonstrates more advanced features, like the 3D visualization feature, which provides creators with levels of analysis that are not accessible in Leaflet.   </p>
        <p>Not only does this provide map creators with additional tools to display data but the controllers in the top left hand of the screen allow the viewer to explore data in a way that fosters increased engagement.   For example, the map above shows polygons outlines of building structures in Aspen, Colorado.  The navigation buttons in the left of the screen allow the user to navigate through this region’s elevation and see how building structures correspond with varying elevations in the region.  While this information can be displayed on a 2D map, the 3D allows the viewer to explore a new visualization and perspective that allows the user to interpret the data differently than if displayed on a 2D map.  </p> 
        <p>Another feature that is unique to this tool is the way ArcGIS JavaScript API connects with other Esri products.  I explored the ArcGIS Developer Dashboard as part of this tutorial which connects ArcGIS JavaScript API and ArcGIS Online.  While I found this tool extremely helpful, I did find it difficult to navigate initially.  Similarly, I found the tutorials difficult to digest at first.  These initial difficulties may have been more representative of my overall beginner level understanding of coding and web development.  As a result, I would recommend beginner coders stick with Leaflet until they feel more comfortable with general coding before advancing to this tool.  </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>    
        In conclusion, I would recommend this tool for intermediate to advanced developers or those interested in expanding beyond the basic functionality of Leaflet.  I would also recommend this tool for beginners that are motivated to display maps with 3D scenes or within time lapse animation, as this is a unique feature to this map, although it may take more time for beginner coders to feel comfortable with this tool.  Similarly, those that are interested in building maps and sharing data across teams may also benefit from transition to this tool due to its sharing capabilities.  Please review below to see this reports references and additional resources.
