        <h3>Tech Report</h3>
        <p>ArcGIS JavaScript API </p>
      
      <p> Report Requirements from canvas:
          
<p>"558 Students only - output will be shared with 458 students who are then required to look it over and provide feedback.

<p>Think about a topic that you would like to investigate further and then prepare the equivalent of a 2-page or 10 slide report on the topic. The report itself could be communicated via a web page you have developed or provided as a PDF on your site. The product that you produce will be shared with the rest of the class so that they can be exposed to the new topic - so make sure and provide some insight based on your experience with the product or code library.

<p>The topic could be anything related to mapping or data visualization that goes up and beyond what we have discussed so far. Examples such as:

<br>A Leaflet Plugin (Links to an external site.) that has not been discussed in the class
<br>ArcGIS Online (Links to an external site.)
<br>Carto (Links to an external site.)
<br>MapBox APIs (Links to an external site.)
<br>Turf.js (Links to an external site.)
<br>D3.js (Links to an external site.)
<br>Google Map API (Links to an external site.)
<br>OpenStreetMap (Links to an external site.)
<br>Mapping with R Studio (Links to an external site.)
<br>Your topic does not need to cover one of the ones I have listed, these are just to get your ideas going. Once you have selected a topic email the idea to me by Thursday March 12th. If you don't get your idea approve by me beforehand points will be taken off your final grade.  

<p>Requirements:

<br>email topic idea to me by Thursday March 12th
<br>2 page or 10 slide report covering your topic
<br>background information about what the tool is and how it can be used to create maps or data visualization
<br>A small example or demo project 
<br>the steps and explanation of how you used the tool complete your project
<br>overall evaluation of the tool (was it easy or difficult to learn or use, does it do what you want and expected, etc.)
<br>links to any resources or datasets you used to complete the report and example project using this technology".</p>
