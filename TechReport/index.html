        <h2>Tech Report: ArcGIS JavaScript API </h2>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>The ArcGIS JavaScript API is a unique tool used by developers to visualize data in an approachable, creative, and consistent way with minimal code.  This tool allows the author to web maps that allow the map to display data in 3D.  The newest version, 4.0, has received positive reviews from developers for its consistent use of an API, or Application Programming Interface (Powell, 2016).  To learn more about a developer's review of this product please click <a href="https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/arcuser/six-reasons-you-should-use-arcgis-api-4-0-for-javascript/">here</a>.  Please continue reading my page for my evaluation of using this tool.  But first, please review the below refresher and resources to gain more information about ArcGIS online, API's, and JavaScript.    </p>
        <h5>What is ArcGIS online?</h5>
        ArcGIS online is communication platform that allows users to map location data and connect it with a variety of information.  This tool is used by a variety of industries including private companies, government, and non-profits, and is easy to share.  Not only is it a tool that can that can help organizations drive data informed decision making, but it is also a tool that can help visualize data in interesting and easily interpreted ways (Esri, 2015).  For more information click <a href="https://youtu.be/FRcv9xmmojE">here</a> to watch a short informational video from Esri or <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/index.html">here</a> to view this tools home page.   
        <h5>JavaScript Refresher</h5>
        JavaScript is a programming languague that is read by an internet browser to create actions on webpages (Code School, 2015). We have been using JavaScript throughout the semester to add various behaviors to our visualizations.  If you are interested in vieweing a video refresher, please click <a href="https://youtu.be/nItSSTwBvSU">here</a>.
        <h5>What is an API?</h5>
        An API, or Application Programming Interface, is often described as similar to a waiter in a restaurant (MuleSoft Videos, 2015; Simply Explained, 2019).  In other words, it is a tool that transitions data and information between computer applications, similar to the way a waiter delivers food to a table from the kitchen.  Commonly used applications, such as the weather app or cheap airfare applications like Kayak, use APIs to connect data to the user by way of the application.  Four key purposes of the API's, as identified in the linked resource in this section, include support in accessing data, hiding website complexities for developers, extending functionality of systems, and acting as gatekeepers to protect user's personal data (Simply Explained, 2019).  These are important aspects to keep in mind as the API allows developers to use minimal and consistent code when creating data visualizations with maps. For more information and examples of APIs can be found in the references <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVvTv9Hy91Q&feature=youtu.be">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY">here</a>.
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        The above section provides a general overview of the tool, what it can be used for, and the key items that make up this tool.  Next, we will move on to how to register, use, and build a map with this tool. 
        <h5>Sign Up, Download, and Become Familiar With The Tool</h5>
        Follow steps 1 and 2 below to sign up, register, and download ArcGIS JavaScript API.  Follow steps 3-5 to familiarize yourself with the tool and it's capabilities.  
        <br>1) Navigate to the tool's home page and explore the site.  To register for this product, click the 'Get Started' button the home page: <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/">ArcGIS JavaScript Home Page</a>
        <br>2) From this page, follow the instructions under the Quick Start Guide to make an ArcGIS for developers account. <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/quick-start/"> Quick Start Guide</a>.
        <br>3) After you make an account, experiment with code from step 3 in the Quick Start Guide and then proceed through the tutorials at the bottom of the Quick Start Guide.  Please note LA 458/558 students can use there preferred code editors and local environments as described in Step 2 of the Quick Guide.  To access the tutorial, you can also follow this link <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/create-a-starter-app/">Tutorials</a>.
        <br>4) Work through the tutorials.  You'll notice some of the tutorials teach the user familar concepts learned in LA 458/558 such as adding layers, popups, and mapping line, polygon, and point graphics.  You'll also notice this tool allows the user to learn new skills such as creating a 3D scence, mapping driving directions, and adding layers to 3D maps.  
        <br>5) Similar to previous coursework, ArcGIS has a variety of basemaps that can be added to the map.  Explore the basemaps here: <a href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/browse/#d=2&type=layers&cont=esriOnly&categories=Basemaps:11111">Basemaps</a>.
        <h3>Example</h3>
        Below, please find an example of a map I created with this tool.  You'll notice this tool allows the map to display in 3D and gives the viewer the angled view of the map.  Each of these items can be adjusted based on the author's preferences for display.  Please click the link <a href="https://github.com/kvanselous/CRP558/blob/master/TechReport/index.html">here</a> to view the code I used to create this map.  I left comments throughout to help readers understand the function of each line of code.
