This exercise requires you to build upon your Leaflet map from exercise 9. Exercises 9 asked you to create a leaflet map with a GeoJSON polygon layer that is symbolized to create a choropleth map. In this exercises you will add a legend to your exercise 9 map. 

I will also be looking for errors in your code (error messages sent to the browser console and basic JS and HTML errors). 

Requirements:

Create an index.html file inside an exercise10 directory in GitHub with a leaflet map displaying your geojson layers (1pt)
Create a legend for your GeoJSON polygon layer that is symbolized as a choropleth map (3pt)
All other components of your maps should stay the same and follow requirements from exercise 9 (1pt)
